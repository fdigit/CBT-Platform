# üöÄ Academic Results Module - Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ **YOU'RE READY TO DEPLOY!**

Everything has been implemented and is ready to go live. Follow this guide to deploy the Academic Results Module.

---

## üìã **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- ‚úÖ All backend APIs implemented (18 endpoints)
- ‚úÖ All frontend components created (11 components)
- ‚úÖ All pages built (teacher, admin, student)
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete (11 guides)
- ‚è≥ Database migration (YOU NEED TO RUN THIS)
- ‚è≥ Seed data (optional but recommended)

---

## üîß **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### **Step 1: Verify Environment Variables**

Check your `.env` file has:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Make sure DATABASE_URL starts with `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://`

---

### **Step 2: Apply Database Changes** ‚≠ê **REQUIRED**

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\User\Documents\fDigit Technologies\CBT"

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database (RECOMMENDED for development)
npx prisma db push

# OR create migration (RECOMMENDED for production)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_academic_results_module
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 3 new tables: `AcademicResult`, `GradingScale`, `TermSession`
- Adds relations to existing tables
- Creates indexes for performance
- Generates TypeScript types

---

### **Step 3: (Optional) Seed Sample Data**

Create sample grading scale and term/session via Admin UI:

1. Login as School Admin
2. Go to `/admin/academic-results/settings`
3. Verify default grading scale is shown (A* to F)
4. Click "Save Grading Scale" to activate it
5. Add a term/session:
   - Term: "First Term"
   - Session: "2024/2025"
   - Start Date: 2024-09-01
   - End Date: 2024-12-15
   - Current: Yes

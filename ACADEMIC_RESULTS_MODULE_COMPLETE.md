## 🚀 Next Steps (Required User Actions)

### **1. Database Configuration** ⚠️ CRITICAL
Your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable needs to be configured correctly:

```env
# MongoDB connection string format
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://username:password@host:port/database"
# OR for MongoDB Atlas
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database"
```

**After configuring, run:**
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This will create the following collections in your database:
- `AcademicResult`
- `GradingScale`
- `TermSession`

### **2. Install Required NPM Packages** ⚠️
The PDF generation feature requires:
```bash
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
npm install --save-dev @types/jspdf-autotable
```

The Excel bulk upload feature requires:
```bash
npm install xlsx
npm install --save-dev @types/xlsx
```

### **3. Seed Initial Data** (Optional but Recommended)
Create default term/session and grading scale via the Admin Settings page at `/admin/academic-results/settings`.

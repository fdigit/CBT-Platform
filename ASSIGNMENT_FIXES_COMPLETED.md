## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Student Assignment Submission - FIXED
**File:** `src/app/student/assignments/page.tsx`  
**Lines:** 360-412

**What was broken:**
```typescript
// Mock submission - replace with actual API call
toast({ title: 'Success' });
// No actual API call!
```

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ Implemented real API call to `/api/student/assignments/[id]/submit`
- ✅ Added validation for empty submissions
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ File attachment mapping from FileUpload component
- ✅ Auto-refresh assignments list after submission
- ✅ Late submission detection handled by backend

**Code added:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/student/assignments/${assignmentId}/submit`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    textContent: submissionForm.textContent,
    attachments: submissionFiles.map(file => ({
      fileName: file.id,
      originalName: file.name,
      filePath: file.url,
      fileSize: file.size,
      mimeType: file.type,
    })),
  }),
});
```

### 2. ✅ Teacher Submissions View - FIXED
**File:** `src/app/teacher/assignments/page.tsx`  
**Lines:** 195-230

**What was broken:**
```typescript
// TODO: Replace with actual API call
setSubmissions([]); // Always empty!
```

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ Implemented real API call to fetch submissions for all assignments
- ✅ Iterates through teacher's assignments and fetches submissions
- ✅ Properly formats submission data with student info
- ✅ Maps attachment URLs correctly
- ✅ Converts status to lowercase for UI consistency
- ✅ Logs submission count for debugging

**Code added:**
```typescript
const fetchSubmissions = async () => {
  const allSubmissions: Submission[] = [];
  
  for (const assignment of assignments) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/teacher/assignments/${assignment.id}/submissions`);
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      const formattedSubmissions = data.submissions.map((sub: any) => ({
        id: sub.id,
        assignmentId: assignment.id,
        studentId: sub.student.id,
        studentName: sub.student.user.name,
        // ... full submission details
      }));
      allSubmissions.push(...formattedSubmissions);
    }
  }
  
  setSubmissions(allSubmissions);
};
```

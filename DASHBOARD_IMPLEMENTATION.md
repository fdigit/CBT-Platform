## üöÄ Getting Started

The dashboard is now fully integrated into the existing admin page at `/admin`. Users with `SUPER_ADMIN` role will see the new dashboard interface.

### Navigation
- Visit `/admin` for the main dashboard overview
- Navigate to `/admin/schools` for school management
- Other sections are placeholder pages ready for implementation

### Customization
All components are modular and can be easily customized:
- Modify colors in Tailwind classes
- Add new navigation items in `Sidebar.tsx`
- Extend chart data in `Charts.tsx`
- Add new statistics cards in `DashboardOverview.tsx`

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The dashboard is designed to be easily extensible:
- **Real-time data** integration with WebSocket
- **Advanced filtering** and search capabilities
- **Export functionality** for reports
- **Dark mode** support
- **Internationalization** (i18n) ready
- **Advanced analytics** and insights

## üìä Sample Data

The dashboard currently uses sample data for demonstration:
- **Student growth**: 6 months of data
- **Exam statistics**: Monthly exam counts
- **Subscription breakdown**: Three subscription types
- **Recent activities**: Sample activity feed

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a professional Super Admin Dashboard that can be easily extended with real data and additional features as needed.

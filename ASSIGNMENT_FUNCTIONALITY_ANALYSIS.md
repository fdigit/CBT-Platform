## ⚠️ Critical Issues (Preventing 100% Functionality)

### 1. **Student Submission UI Not Wired to API** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/app/student/assignments/page.tsx` (lines 360-378)

**Issue:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (assignmentId: string) => {
  try {
    // Mock submission - replace with actual API call  ← PROBLEM!
    toast({
      title: 'Success',
      description: 'Assignment submitted successfully',
    });
    // ... no actual fetch call to API
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Students **CANNOT** actually submit homework/assignments through the UI, even though the API endpoint exists and works.

**Fix Required:** Replace the mock implementation with actual API call:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/student/assignments/${assignmentId}/submit`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    textContent: submissionForm.textContent,
    attachments: submissionFiles.map(file => ({
      fileName: file.id,
      originalName: file.name,
      filePath: file.url,
      fileSize: file.size,
      mimeType: file.type,
    })),
  }),
});
```

### 2. **Teacher Submissions View Not Functional** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/app/teacher/assignments/page.tsx` (lines 195-204)

**Issue:**
```typescript
const fetchSubmissions = async () => {
  try {
    // TODO: Replace with actual API call to fetch submissions
    // For now, set empty array  ← PROBLEM!
    setSubmissions([]);
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Teachers **CANNOT** view student submissions in the UI, even though the API endpoint exists.

**Fix Required:** Implement actual API call to fetch submissions.

### 3. **Edit Assignment Functionality Not Implemented** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Location:** `src/app/teacher/assignments/page.tsx` (line 944)

**Issue:** The "Edit" button exists but has no onClick handler.

**Impact:** Teachers cannot edit existing assignments through the UI.

### 4. **View Assignment Details Modal Incomplete** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Location:** `src/app/teacher/assignments/page.tsx`

**Issue:** No modal or detailed view for assignments in the teacher page.

**Impact:** Teachers cannot view full assignment details after creation.

### 5. **Notification System Not Implemented** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Locations:**
- `src/app/api/student/assignments/[id]/submit/route.ts` (line 112)
- `src/app/api/teacher/assignments/[id]/submissions/[submissionId]/grade/route.ts` (line 92)

**Issue:** Multiple TODO comments indicate notifications should be sent but aren't:
```typescript
// TODO: Send notification to teacher about new submission
// TODO: Send notification to student about graded assignment
```

**Impact:** No real-time alerts for submissions or grading.

---

## 🟢 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

### 1. **Student Count Mock Data**
**Location:** `src/app/api/teacher/assignments/route.ts` (line 101)
```typescript
const totalStudents = assignment.class ? 30 : 0; // Mock - get actual count
```
Should query actual student enrollment in the class.

### 2. **File Serving Endpoint Missing**
**Location:** `src/app/api/student/assignments/route.ts` (line 146)
```typescript
url: `/api/attachments/${att.fileName}`, // TODO: Implement file serving
```
Files are stored in Cloudinary, but a dedicated serving endpoint would be better for access control.

### 3. **Attachment Management in Update**
**Location:** `src/app/api/student/assignments/[id]/submit/route.ts` (line 218)
```typescript
// Note: For simplicity, we're not handling attachment updates here
// In a real implementation, you'd need to handle adding/removing attachments
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### To Test Current Functionality:
1. ✅ Teacher can create assignments with type "HOMEWORK"
2. ✅ Teacher can upload files to assignments
3. ✅ Students can view assignments
4. ✅ Students can download assignment files
5. ❌ Students CANNOT submit assignments (UI not connected)
6. ❌ Teachers CANNOT view submissions (UI not connected)
7. ❌ Teachers CANNOT grade submissions (UI not connected)

### Test Checklist for Full Implementation:
- [ ] Create homework assignment as teacher
- [ ] Verify student can see assignment
- [ ] Student submits homework with files
- [ ] Teacher sees submission notification
- [ ] Teacher views submission
- [ ] Teacher grades submission with feedback
- [ ] Student sees grade notification
- [ ] Student views grade and feedback
- [ ] Teacher edits assignment
- [ ] Test late submission marking
- [ ] Test file upload limits
- [ ] Test permission boundaries

## 💡 Conclusion

The assignment/homework system has a **solid foundation** with:
- ✅ Complete database schema
- ✅ Fully functional backend APIs
- ✅ Beautiful UI components
- ✅ File upload system
- ✅ Assignment creation workflow

**However, it is NOT 100% functional** because:
- 🔴 Student cannot submit assignments (frontend not connected to backend)
- 🔴 Teacher cannot view or grade submissions (frontend not connected to backend)
- 🔴 Edit functionality missing in UI

**Estimated time to reach 100% functionality: 8-12 hours of development**

The architecture is excellent and the hard work is done. The remaining work is primarily "plumbing" - connecting existing UI components to existing API endpoints.

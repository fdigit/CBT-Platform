# 📝 Assignment Submission Flow - Complete Analysis

## 🎯 Overview
When a student submits an assignment, here's the **complete step-by-step flow** through the system:

---

## 📱 STUDENT SIDE - Submission Process

### Step 1: Student Opens Assignment
**Location**: Student Dashboard → Assignments Tab

1. Student logs in as `student1@littleteddies.com`
2. Navigates to `/student/assignments`
3. Sees list of **published assignments** for their class
4. Assignment card shows:
   - Title & subject
   - Due date (with warnings if overdue/due soon)
   - Type badge (Assignment, Homework, etc.)
   - Status badge (Not Submitted, Submitted, Graded)
   - Teacher name
   - Max score

### Step 2: View Assignment Details
**Action**: Student clicks "View" button

Modal shows:
- Full assignment title & description
- Complete instructions
- Downloadable attachments from teacher
- Due date
- Max score
- "Submit Assignment" button (if not yet submitted)

### Step 3: Click Submit Button
**Action**: Student clicks "Submit" or "Submit Assignment"

**Submission Modal Opens** showing:
- Written Response field (textarea)
- File upload area
- Due date reminder
- Cancel/Submit buttons

### Step 4: Fill Submission Form
**Student can provide:**

**Option A**: Text content only
```typescript
textContent: "Here is my homework answer..."
attachments: []
```

**Option B**: Files only
```typescript
textContent: ""
attachments: [file1.pdf, file2.jpg]
```

**Option C**: Both text + files ✅ Recommended
```typescript
textContent: "My explanation..."
attachments: [homework.pdf]
```

**Validation**: Must have EITHER text OR files (cannot submit empty)

### Step 5: Upload Files (if any)
**File Upload Component**: `FileUpload`

**Process:**
1. Student selects files (drag & drop or click)
2. Files upload to `/api/upload/temp-file`
3. Files stored in **Cloudinary** (temp folder)
4. Returns file metadata:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "temp_userId_timestamp_filename",
     name: "homework.pdf",
     url: "https://cloudinary.../homework.pdf",
     size: 1024567,
     type: "application/pdf"
   }
   ```

**File Limits:**
- Max size: **10MB per file** (for student submissions)
- Max files: **5 files**
- Allowed types: PDF, Word, Excel, Images (jpg, png, gif)

### Step 6: Submit Assignment
**Action**: Student clicks "Submit Assignment" button

**Frontend Handler**: `handleSubmit(assignmentId)`

**What happens:**
1. **Validation** - Check if textContent OR files exist
2. **API Call** - POST to `/api/student/assignments/${assignmentId}/submit`
3. **Payload sent:**
```json
{
  "textContent": "Student's written response...",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "fileName": "temp_userid_123_homework",
      "originalName": "homework.pdf",
      "filePath": "https://cloudinary.../homework.pdf",
      "fileSize": 1024567,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 BACKEND - API Processing

### API Endpoint: `/api/student/assignments/[id]/submit`
**File**: `src/app/api/student/assignments/[id]/submit/route.ts`

### Backend Flow:

#### 1️⃣ **Authentication Check**
```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session || session.user.role !== 'STUDENT') {
  return 401 Unauthorized
}
```

#### 2️⃣ **Get Student Profile**
```typescript
const student = await prisma.student.findUnique({
  where: { userId: session.user.id },
  include: { class: true }
});
```

#### 3️⃣ **Verify Assignment Access**
Checks:
- ✅ Assignment exists
- ✅ Assignment is PUBLISHED
- ✅ Assignment is for student's class OR is general (classId: null)

```typescript
const assignment = await prisma.assignment.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: assignmentId,
    status: 'PUBLISHED',
    OR: [
      { classId: student.classId },  // For student's class
      { classId: null }              // Or general assignment
    ]
  }
});
```

#### 4️⃣ **Check Due Date**
```typescript
if (assignment.dueDate && new Date() > assignment.dueDate) {
  submissionStatus = 'LATE';  // Mark as late but allow submission
} else {
  submissionStatus = 'SUBMITTED';
}
```

**Late Submission Behavior:**
- ✅ **ALLOWS late submissions**
- 🏷️ Marks status as 'LATE' instead of 'SUBMITTED'
- ⚠️ Teacher sees "Late" badge

#### 5️⃣ **Check for Duplicate Submission**
```typescript
const existingSubmission = await prisma.assignmentSubmission.findUnique({
  where: {
    assignmentId_studentId: {
      assignmentId,
      studentId: student.id
    }
  }
});

if (existingSubmission) {
  return 400 "Assignment already submitted"
}
```

**Prevents:**
- Multiple submissions from same student
- Accidental double-submit

#### 6️⃣ **Create Submission in Database**
```typescript
const submission = await prisma.assignmentSubmission.create({
  data: {
    assignmentId,
    studentId: student.id,
    textContent,
    status: submissionStatus,  // 'SUBMITTED' or 'LATE'
    submittedAt: new Date(),   // Auto-timestamp
    attachments: {
      create: attachments.map(att => ({
        fileName: att.fileName,
        originalName: att.originalName,
        filePath: att.filePath,
        fileSize: att.fileSize,
        mimeType: att.mimeType
      }))
    }
  }
});
```

**Database Changes:**
- ✅ New record in `AssignmentSubmission` table
- ✅ New records in `SubmissionAttachment` table (for each file)
- ✅ Timestamp recorded
- ✅ Status set (SUBMITTED or LATE)

#### 7️⃣ **TODO: Send Notification** ⚠️
```typescript
// TODO: Send notification to teacher about new submission
```

**Current Status:** Not implemented
**Should notify:**
- Teacher via in-app notification
- Teacher via email (optional)
- Include: student name, assignment title, submission time

#### 8️⃣ **Return Success Response**
```json
{
  "submission": {
    "id": "submission_id",
    "status": "SUBMITTED" | "LATE",
    "submittedAt": "2025-10-07T10:30:00Z",
    "textContent": "...",
    "attachments": [...]
  },
  "message": "Assignment submitted successfully" | "Assignment submitted late"
}
```

### What Student Sees:

#### 1. **Success Toast**
```
✅ Success

#### 2. **Modal Closes**
- Submission form clears
- Modal closes automatically

```typescript

## 🔐 How It Works

**Creation:**
- Password generated/entered → Hashed with bcrypt → Stored in DB
- Plain password shown **once** to admin

**Login:**
- Student enters email + password
- System compares with bcrypt
- Creates session if valid
- Redirects to student dashboard

## 📝 Important

✅ **Passwords are hashed** (not stored plain text)  
✅ **Secure authentication** with bcrypt  
✅ **Role-based access** with middleware  
✅ **Session management** with NextAuth  

⚠️ **Password shown only during creation!**  
→ Admin must copy and share with student

## 🎯 Complete!

The student login system is **fully functional** and secure! 🎉
